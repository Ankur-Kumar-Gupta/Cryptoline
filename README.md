## Features

- **Encryption Methods:**
  - Reverse Cipher
  - Caesar Cipher
  - Vigenere Cipher
  - Hash Cipher (Customized cipher algo completly developed by me)

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program offers a user-friendly command-line interface with an ASCII art header.

- **Safe Input Handling:** User input is handled securely using `cin` to prevent common input-related issues.

- **Clean and Organized Code:** The code has been optimized for readability and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **C++ Compiler:** You need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Common choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux, MinGW on Windows, and Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS.

- **Visual Studio Code:** While you can use any text editor, this README assumes you are using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

- **C/C++ Extension for VSCode:** Install the "C/C++" extension provided by Microsoft in VSCode for a better development experience.
